## Types of error

### Syntax error

### Runtime error
Depending on the machine you are working on, the machine will send a different error & logs because they are not working on the same runtime. Firefox is SpiderMonkey, chrome uses v8, Safari uses WebKit

### Logic error
everything works according to js, but it doesn't do what you want to
